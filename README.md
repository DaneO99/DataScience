# DataScience Repository

Welcome to my comprehensive Data Science learning and project repository! This repository contains materials, exercises, and projects covering fundamental and advanced topics in data science, machine learning, and data analysis.

## 📚 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into four main learning areas:

### 1. 🐍 Python Basics
Foundation Python programming concepts essential for data science work.
- Core Python syntax and data structures
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Python libraries and package management
- Best practices for clean, readable code

### 2. 📊 Working With Data
Essential skills for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- Data loading and parsing from various sources
- Data cleaning and transformation techniques
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data wrangling with pandas and numpy
- Handling missing data and outliers
- Data validation and quality assessment

### 3. 📈 Visualization
Creating compelling visual representations of data and insights.
- Static visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn
- Interactive visualizations with plotly
- Statistical plotting and distribution analysis
- Dashboard creation and storytelling with data
- Best practices for effective data communication

### 4. 🤖 Modeling
Machine learning algorithms, model development, and evaluation.
- Supervised learning (regression, classification)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation and performance metrics
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model interpretation and explainability

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Git for version control

### Recommended Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DaneO99/DataScience.git
cd DataScience
